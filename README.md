# imgapi

## ⚠️ This software is not yet suitable for production use. ⚠️

This is Wavy's internal image API used for image-related commands.

Docker images and further information will be added soon.

Basic to do list:

- More image functions and endpoints
- Consistent responses
- Proper documentation
- Background job support (if needed)
- Compress images to be <=25MB or host them in a bucket/on a webserver
